# MTG_simulator (Mixnet Topology Generator Simulator)

### Introduction
This is the simulator for mixnet topological construction algorithms.
We implemented a scalable Mixnet construction model with the four mixnet construction 
algorithms in Python. We use Gurobi 
optimizer to solve the linear bin-packing 
optimization problem.

The bandwidths of Mixnodes are generated by fitting to the bandwidth distribution of 
Tor relays from its historical data. We use a R package 
to fit the 
bandwidth data captured from [Tor](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search) consensus documents and server descriptors 
from January 2021 to March 2021.
Among three common right-skewed distributions
we choose the gamma distribution as the best-fitted via maximum 
likelihood estimation (MLE) method.

### Advresarial Model
In our simulation, we consider a strategic adversary who can maximise the
quantity of traffic they are 
expected to compromise 
by controlling the number of malicious mixes and their bandwidths.
1. naive adversary: the adversary distributes all bandwidth resources evenly
across their malicious mixes
2. smart adversary: the adversary allocates bandwidth resources unevenly across their malicious mixes.

### Run
To run this simulator, please follow the following steps:
- Install python3
- Install [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/)
- Change parameters in run_simulation.sh to approriate values
- Run ./run_simulation.sh in the terminal
