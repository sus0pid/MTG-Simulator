# MTG_simulator (Mixnet Topology Generator Simulator)

### Introduction
This is the simulator for simulating mixnet topological construction algorithms.
We implemented a scalable Mixnet construction model with the four mixnet construction 
algorithms (i.e., bwrand, randrand, randbp, and bowtie) in Python. We use Gurobi 
optimizer to solve the linear bin-packing 
optimization problem.

The bandwidths of Mixnodes are generated by fitting to the bandwidth distribution of 
Tor relays from its historical data. We use a R package 
to fit the 
bandwidth data captured from [Tor](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search) consensus documents and server descriptors 
from January 2021 to March 2021.
Among three common right-skewed distributions
we choose the gamma distribution as the best-fitted via maximum 
likelihood estimation (MLE) method. Given the number of mixes, MTG can generate a pool of mix nodes in any size. In order to show the comparison between four algorithms, we run the simulator with the same set of benign mix nodes (i.e., data from Benign_Mixes/1000_benignmix.csv).

### Technical goal
The objective of this tool is to generate the mixnet topologies assuming a strategic adversary who has a fixed budget to operate mixnodes with different construction algorithm. The generated topological configuration is determined by the construction algorithm, clearly showing the position of each mixnodes in every epoch. The detailed topological configuration data is stored in "logs/xxx_layout.csv"

The adversary can deanonymise all messages travel through a path that is composed of all malicious mixes. Thus, the security of the generated network is evaluated by the fraction of total paths in the network topology that are fully compromised (i.e., comprosed entirely of the adversarial relays). This metric is shown in the output log file ("attack_profit" in "logs/xxx_log.csv").
